This is the beginning of the an easier manner of importing resources.

This was started after a manual import of a Okta resources and google for the start of an RBAC system.
I felt that the there was need to make this easier and a cli choice.

PLEASE help me add new reources and services and make this a usable app.

The plan is to ask for the service
Ask what resources you wish to import 
Create the terraform for the resources and output a plan.

Okta base is complete and does do this

PLEASE ENSURE YOU DO NOT UPLOAD KEYS
